# irc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aaronweiss74/irc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aaronweiss74/irc) #
An IRC library in Rust. Just went through serious change. Unit tests, more features, and more
examples coming soon. The existing examples should serve as a good basis. You can find up-to-date,
pre-made documentation online [here](http://www.rust-ci.org/aaronweiss74/irc/doc/irc/).
